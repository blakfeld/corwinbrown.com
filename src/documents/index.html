		<h2>Systems Administration</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Server deployments should be consistent, repeatable, entirely automated, and shouldn't contain any hacks. If an architecture doesn't meet all of those criteria, then as far as I'm concerned, the work isn't done.</p>
		<p>DevOps is not only an important mindset, it's the future of enterprise computing. The days where SSHing into a machine and doing some things was a reasonable method are ending quickly. Are you prepared for the future?</p>

		<h2>Development</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>I have over a decade of experience in writing whatever code is needed to accomplish the task set in front of me. I've done extensive scripting and automation using Bash and Python, as well as web development using everything from a few PHP frameworks to Django to Node.js and Angular.js.</p>
		<p>That only scratches the surface. I've also done Android and iOS development, not to mention some light game programming with the Unreal Engine, Unity3D, and the Source Engine.</p>
		<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/blakfeld">github</a> for some examples of my Open Source contributions.</p>

		<h2>Pretty Pictures</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>What's that? You need some art? I can hook you up with some art. I've spent my whole life head down in some sort of creative endeavor, whether it be music, illustration, sculpting, or 3D modeling.</p>
		<p>Generally these days I work as digitally as I can (Big surprise for a computer guy, right?), painting in Photoshop, and sculpting with a combination of 3D Studio Max and ZBrush.</p>
